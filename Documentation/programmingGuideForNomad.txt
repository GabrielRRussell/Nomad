Nomad CPU Programming Information|
_________________________________|

Until the nomad is completely designed and a compiler is built, all code is developed in Binary. To help speed up the process, a handy cheat sheet of hexadecimal values will be used to show off the instruction format.

Little Endian (LSB -> MSB) programming Layout: 
	Operation - Register Select - Operand

OR OP is the format. Four hex characters, each representing four bits. O is Operation, R is register select, OP is operand.

Here are some operation hex translations:

0: Nop
1: Add
2: Sub
3: And
4: Not
5: Or
6: Xor
7: LSL
8: LSR
9: Mov
A: LMR
B: LRM
C: JEQ
D: JNQ
E: JGT
F: JLT

0: A
1: B
9: s0 Hex Displays
A: s1 Screen
B: s2 LEDs
C: i0 Keyboard
D: i1 Dipswitch
E: i2 Joystick
F: i3 Button Array
