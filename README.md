# Nomad (Legacy 1.0)
Custom CPU made in Logisim. HCS Tech Fair 2019

This is an older version of it that I did not upload to Github.

The main reason being that my foolish self made some very dumb mistakes in the planning phase that I did not catch. I would highly recommend that you not use this circuit as any sort of guide or pathway to follow. I made several mistakes that I do not believe should be in the final product, and as such scrapped it entirely.

These are simply remnants of an older product, and as such I would recommend that you check out Nomad 2.0 Non-Legacy to learn more about the actual project results. 

All of the documentation here is outlined in the lone txt file that I created. It has mistakes, typos, and bad grammar. It was never meant to see the light of the internet, so don't expect much from it.
